# To Add Threaded Python ping #

  * You must be able to call `pyhton _script.py_` from the web user.

  * Download **ping.py** and **generateip.php**.

  * Replace the current `generateip.php` file in your IPAM root directory.

  * Move the `ping.py` file to the `inc` folder.


You now will be using a threaded ping when generating an IP.
