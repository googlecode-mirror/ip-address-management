# Upgrade procedure #

---


I have made the upgrade process very simple if you have not modified the code on your own.

  * Make a copy of your db.php file in the `inc` folder.

  * Unzip the new ipam\_x.zip replacing your current ipam site files.

  * Replace the default db.php file with your already configured one in the `inc` folder.


That is it!! Your are ready with the updated site.

For those who have modified the code, here is a list of the files changed in version 1.01:

  * `inc/generateip.php`

  * `inc/admin.functions.php`

  * `inc/functions.inc.php`
